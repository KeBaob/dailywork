I can't help stop fucking the swiper.
why?
because the 'offline-clinic' part don't work as what I thought.
I tryed to solve this problem in many ways but I failed. 
How can it be so "pi" ???
now it is 0:37 at mid-night. I have to go to sleep now.
Tomorrow I will go to work. 
In my company, someone maybe can solve this problem.
I hope tomorrow will not be so bad.
wow.
I change my app into vue-app sucessfully. It is the only thing that can make me happy.
I achieved my goal.
Never make myself feel didappointed. 

The target of tomorrow:
1.solve the swiper problem of vue-app.
2.Learn how the vue-cli worked.
3.If there are time left, learn the vueX.
4.the most important thing : 

	GET UP EARLY TOMORROW NO MATTER HOW LATE I SLLEP TONIGHT.

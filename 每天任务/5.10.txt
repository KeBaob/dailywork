the vue document shows that the core livrary is fucused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

today I learned how to use swiper. and solve the problem about the first picture can't run behind the last picture directly. 
The reason for this problem is I didn't use the property of 'stopOnLastSlide'.

now it is 21:33 at night. I work overtime everyday though I have been here for 2 days. And also I will come here tomorrow, it is saturday tomorrow and we are not forced to come but of one's own accord. I have to learn Vue as soon as posible. 
I also have to learn how to adapt my code to any mobile. 
Go on working. And never say hard.

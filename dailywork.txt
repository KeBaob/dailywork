This is what i should do everyday.
Since I came to this company, I fell in love with my job.
Everytime I remember what I did in the past half year, I thought it worth my efforts.
Today I get a job I was very looking forward to. Maybe I don't know how to express my feelings. But I know I should work hard to make progess in it. 
Few years later, also is my dream: I want to go to Beijing. Not only for monney,but also for my deeply dreaming about it.
